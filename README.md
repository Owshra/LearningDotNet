# LearningDotNet
Owshra Initial project
Somehow, I made a README.md before but deleted it, so recreating now.

okay, so the task:

Work in the main function and complete the tasks:
•	Create an array of string size 5. Fill array items with values.
•	Print all words using loop.
•	Create an int array size 20. Fill values from 0 till 20.
•	Print numbers backwards.
When done stage and commit changes using VisualStudio and merge “feature/implement-code” to master. For merging you can use Visual Studio or GitBash.
And if you have github account you can push LearningDotNet repository to your remote (use public);

And here are my results:
